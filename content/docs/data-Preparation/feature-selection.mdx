title: Feature Selection
description: This endpoint allows users to upload a file and apply a specified feature selection method to reduce the number of features based on variance, correlations, or statistical tests.
---

## Endpoint: `POST /feature-selection`

### Request Parameters

#### File Upload
- `file` (required): The file to be processed. Supported formats include CSV.


#### Form Parameters
- `method` (required): The feature selection method to apply. Supported values:
  - `variance_threshold`: Removes features with variance below a specified threshold.
  - `pearson_correlation`: Removes features with a Pearson correlation coefficient below a given threshold.
  - `spearman_correlation`: Removes features with a Spearman correlation coefficient below a given threshold.
  - `chi2`: Selects features based on the Chi-square statistical test.
  - `anova`: Selects features using an ANOVA F-test.
- `target_column` (optional): The target column for correlation or statistical tests (required for Pearson, Spearman, Chi2, and ANOVA).
- `variance_threshold` (optional): Minimum variance threshold for `variance_threshold` method. Default is `0.0`.
- `correlation_threshold` (optional): Minimum correlation threshold for Pearson and Spearman methods. Default is `0.9`.
- `p_value_threshold` (optional): Maximum p-value threshold for Chi2 and ANOVA methods. Default is `0.05`.
### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/feature-selection" \
-F "file=@data.csv" \
