title: Train-Test Splitting
description: This endpoint processes an uploaded dataset and splits it into training and testing sets based on the specified splitting method.
---

## Endpoint: `POST /prepTrainTest`

### Request Parameters

#### File Upload
- `file` (required): CSV file containing the dataset to be split.

#### Form Parameters
- `splitting_method` (optional, default: `stratified`)
  - Method for splitting the dataset.
  - Supported values: `stratified`, `time-based`, `group-based`, `shuffle`.
- `target_column` (optional, default: `""`)
  - The name of the target column used for stratification, grouping, or time-based splitting.
- `group_column` (optional, default: `""`)
  - The column to be used for `group-based` splitting.

### Splitting Methods

- **Stratified (`stratified`)**:
  - Ensures that the training and testing sets maintain the same proportion of target classes.
  - Requires `target_column` to be specified.

- **Time-Based (`time-based`)**:
  - Splits data chronologically based on the `target_column`.
  - Uses the 80th percentile as the threshold for splitting.
  - Requires `target_column` to contain valid datetime values.

- **Group-Based (`group-based`)**:
  - Splits data while maintaining group integrity, ensuring all data points in a group remain in the same split.
  - Requires both `target_column` and `group_column` to be specified.

- **Shuffle (`shuffle`)**:
  - Randomly splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Requires `target_column` to be specified.

### Response
- Returns downloadable files containing the split datasets.
- Depending on the splitting method, the returned files will include:
  - `X_train.csv`, `X_test.csv`, `y_train.csv`, `y_test.csv` (for `stratified`, `group-based`, and `shuffle` methods).
  - `train.csv`, `test.csv` (for `time-based` method).

### Errors
- If `target_column` is not found in the dataset.
- If `group_column` is specified but does not exist in the dataset (for `group-based` splitting).
- If `time-based` splitting is used but `target_column` is not a valid datetime column.
